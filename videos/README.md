# Videos Directory

You can upload your video files in this directory.

For example, if you have a video named `my_awesome_video.mp4`, you can upload it here. Then, in your `index.html`, you would link to it like this:

```html
<video controls>
    <source src="videos/my_awesome_video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>
```

**Note on `placeholder_video.mp4`**: This is an empty file to prevent a "file not found" error on the main page. You should replace it with your own video or delete the video section from `index.html` if you don't have one.
